<div class="container center">
	<div class="normal-Montserrat"> Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps </div>
	<div class="large-anton">changing directions.</div>
</br>
	<div class="normal-Montserrat"> You change direction but the sandstorm chases you. You turn again,<i> but the storm adjusts. </i></div>
</br>
	<div class="large-anton"> Over and over </div>
	<div class="normal-Montserrat">you play this out, like some ominous dance with death just before dawn. </div>

	<div class="large-anton">Why?</div> 
	<div class="normal-Montserrat">Because this storm isn’t something that blew in from far away, something that has nothing to do with you. </div>
</br>
	<div class="large-anton"><b>This storm is <u> you.</u></b></div> 
</br>
	<div class="normal-anton"> Something inside of you. So all you can do is give in to it, step right inside the storm, closing your eyes and plugging up your ears so the sand doesn’t get in, and walk through it, step by step. </div>
</br>
	<div class="large-anton"> <i>There’s no sun there, no moon, no direction, no sense of time.</i></div>
</br>
	<div class="normal-Montserrat">  Just fine white sand swirling up into the sky like pulverized bones. That’s the kind of sandstorm you need to imagine.</div>
</br>
	<div class="med-anton"> And you really will have to make it through that violent, metaphysical, symbolic storm. </div>

	<div class="normal-Montserrat">No matter how metaphysical or symbolic it might be, make no mistake about it: it will cut through flesh like a thousand razor blades. </div>
</br>
	<div class="large-anton"> People will bleed there, and you will bleed too. Hot, red blood. You’ll catch that blood in your hands, your own blood and the blood of others. </div>
</br>
	<div class="normal-Montserrat"> And once the storm is over you won’t remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. <i> You won’t even be sure, in fact, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm you won’t be the same person who walked in. </i></div>

	<div class="large-anton"> That’s what this storm’s all about.</div>
